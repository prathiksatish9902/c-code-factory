# Variables
Variabless allows us to name the data that is stored in the memory.


## Data Types
it tells to the compiler that the entered data of particular type.

- int (integer): data type used to store the integers.
**size = 4 bytes**.
example : int a = 5;
- float : data type used to store the decimal numbers.
**size = 4 bytes**.
example : float a = 5.5;
**if we dont append f in the end it is considered as double value**.
float a = 5.5f.
- char (character) : data type used to store the characters.
**size = 1 byte**.
example : char a  = 'A';

- bool (boolean) : 
here only two values can be stored 0 or 1 .
**size = 1 byte**.
example : bool a = true;

- double :
it is also used to store the decimal numbers .
**size = 8 bytes**.
example : double a = 4.34;
difference between float and double is accuracy .
